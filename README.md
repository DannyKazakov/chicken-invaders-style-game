After you go through the registration and login, the settings screen will appear
where you can choose the type of spaceship and the chickens you will play with.
In addition, you will choose the timer for the game and the keyboard shot button. Immediately after that 
you will go to the game window which will be launched with the settings you have defined.
On the game screen you will receive an indication about the number of lives left for the current round, the time remaining and the score you have accumulated so far. At the end of each round, the result you have accumulated will be displayed according to its position in the results table.

All that's left now is just to start and play.
Hope you enjoy!
